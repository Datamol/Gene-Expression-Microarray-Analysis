#R-I (M-A) plot 
#A "ratio-intensity plot" looks like a scatterplot that has been rotated 45 degrees.
#It's the most common plot associated with lowess normalization.
#After choosing the two columns of data you wish to compare, begin by calculating "M" and "A" for each expression value.
#A = mean intensity = 1/2 * log2(experiment 1 * experiment 2)
#M = log2 ratio = log2(experiment 1 / experiment 2)
#but since the exprssion values have already been log2-transformed, we can add and substract instead.

# Volcano plot
#These plots will help compare two methods for determination of differential expression: fold changes and t tests.
#The x-axis is the ratio between two tissues and the y-axis is the p-value from the t test from the same two tissues.
#Start by reading the expression and t-test p-values and choosing a tissue.
